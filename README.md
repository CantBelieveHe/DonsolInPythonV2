A remake of the card game designed by John Eternal.
Inpsired by the adaption created by 100Rabits.
Code written by Carson Elmer without the use of AI.

The game runs in the command line and requires a local install of python. Simply run main.py to begin playing the game.
I am currently looking into packaging the game together into a single executable, but running it through pyinstaller flags it as malware, so I am doing more research before uploading to the world.
